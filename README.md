# Targeted problem to be solved: Wedding Photoshoot Chaos!

- Difficulty managing large groups
- Disorientation and confusion 
- Guest Interference 
- Missing guest in portraits
- Time management

# Solutions the Impeccable Photoshoot App provides and Who benefits?


- Bride and Groom can now Pre-plan desired portraits, exactly how they would like the photographer to take them. The client is able to assure specific portraits with specific guests are not missed. They also decide who stands next to them. I also provide a common and practical suggestion list indicating how photographers tend to organize the guests to give clients an initial hint.


- The Photographer is now able to Personalize the photoshoot section. He now has a clear understanding of who should be on each frame, and their positions. Now the photographer (or the assistant) can easily call the guests by their names but must importantly is able to notify the client (inmediately) if a guest is missing.  (no more yelling!!!!) and now the photographer is exempt from being blamed if the guests are not present and don't appear in the portraits)


- Now that the photogreaphers are able to Improve their workflow and time managemengt the wedding planner does not have to worry about this section interrupting their stablished schedule and the event can keep on running on time and smoothly.

- All the guests can now relax, refresh and have a drink before proceeding to the reception (or next section). Protectig the Bride and Groom (and the wedding party) from long sun exposures and finishing as quickly as possible, increases the chances of the subject to provide a more natural look and smile. Now the photographer can concentrate their tension into their main focus which to take stunning images and assure an impeccable photoshoot
